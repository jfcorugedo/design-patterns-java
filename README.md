# Design Patterns (java implementation)

This repository contains all the design patterns described by the gang of four, coded using Java.

## Why did I learn how to use design patterns?

I usually use patterns to apply two different rules:
 * Don't reinvent the wheel all the time
 * Use a common language tu explain problems and talk about technical topics
 
Patterns are some very good abstractions to solve many common problems we tend to find while we are working.

It may seem like we solve completely different problems all the time.

However, most of the problems we solve are generated by the tools we use, not by the external problem at hand (accidental complexity comes here).

This is where patterns come to the rescue. They are common solutions to common problems in a wide range of external problem contexts.

In addition, when you are dealing with a well-known problem, it is quite useful to talk about it with your colleges using a common language. Patterns are key words that help everyone understand the problem.
Imagine you are describing a house, you might say: "It is one-bathroom, three-bedrooms house". In this context, Bathroom and Bedroom are keywords.
In a technical conversation: Strategy, Visitor, Chain of responsability are also valuable keywords to explain a problem and a possible solution. It is some kind of common vocabulary.

NOTE: Be aware that each pattern is an abstraction and adds some level of complexity to the code. So it must be chosen wisely, to avoid overcomplicated solutions.

## Patterns groups

Patterns are grouped in three main categories based on the kind of problems they try to solve:

### Creational

This group consists on all the patterns that solves how objects are created:

* [Singleton](./docs/creational/Singleton.md)
* [Builder]()
* [Prototype]()
* [Factory]()
* [AbstractFactory]()


### Structural
//TODO

### Behavioral
//TODO
